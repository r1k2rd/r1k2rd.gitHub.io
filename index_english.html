			<p>	Feel like retanking your car and increasing fuel costs are really draining you wallet each month?
				In that case cycling might be something worth considering. </p>

			<p>Biking is an awesome way to burn calories and get lean. Even if you use your bicycle
		 	only for 30min per day to get to your destination and back home, if you think about it,
		 	 those minutes amount to a lot of time if you do it every day. Check out how much calories
			you can potentially burn whether you like to take it slow or go fast. Just enter your 
			weight and approximate speed you like to cruise with and see how many calories you 
			can burn per hour:</p>

		<p>The amount of calories burned depends on a few things though: roughness of your local streets,
			condition of your bicycle, altitude change etc. For example you will have to pedal harder
			with empty tyres and on a sandy road compared to an asphalt or a concrete road. Riding downhill
			doesn't really burn many calories because gravity is doing the work for you but going uphill
			can burn a lot of calories because you will be working against the gravity and believe me: when
			you feel your thighs burn on top of that hill, you will know that now you can 
			<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">skip a leg day</span> if you
			are a gym person. Taking on a sprinting challenge or an uphill challenge will make your legs do
			anaerobic work that gives your legs a really well rounded workout, try for yourself!  </p>

			<p> It is a known fact that regular physical activity can help you avoid diseases such as
			obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and arthritis. What separates cycling
			(and swimming for example)from other activities is that it is a low impact activity which means
			that the strain on your joints is reduced compared to running or walking(which are also great
			activities though). Cycling every day or multiple times per week:</p>
